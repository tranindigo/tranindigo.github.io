      <description>Workflows are an essential part of many businesses, whether it’s processing data, automating reports, or orchestrating machine learning pipelines. Managing these workflows manually can be time-consuming and error-prone. This is where Apache Airflow comes in.&#xA;Airflow is a powerful, open-source tool that allows you to programmatically create, schedule, and monitor workflows. With Airflow, workflows are defined as code, which means they are easy to manage, version, and share. In this guide, we’ll introduce you to Airflow and walk you through creating your first DAG, the core component of Airflow.</description>

      <description>In this latest installment of my Kubernetes series, we&amp;rsquo;ll use Helm, a handy tool that makes deploying resources in Kubernetes easier and faster. We&amp;rsquo;ll start by deploying a basic NGINX service, a popular and straightforward choice for getting started with Kubernetes clusters. This example will guide you through using Helm to quickly set up a working service in your Kubernetes environment. Additionally, we&amp;rsquo;ll deploy the AWS Secrets Store CSI Driver, which allows your Kubernetes pods to securely retrieve secrets from AWS, adding an extra layer of functionality to your deployment.</description>

      <title>Streaming Images to AWS S3 Using Ruby on Rails and Multipart/Form-Data</title>
      <link>https://tranindigo.github.io/posts/streaming-images/</link>

      <description>When dealing with image uploads in a web application, handling large files efficiently is crucial. Storing images in memory can lead to significant memory usage, especially with large or numerous files. These large files are waste of server resources, cause unnecessary computation, and if you read them into memory, can have great scalability concerns. Instead, you can stream images directly to AWS S3 using multipart/form-data to avoid memory bloat. This article will walk you through how to achieve this using Ruby on Rails.</description>

      <title>How to serve Lambda through an AWS Load Balancer</title>
      <link>https://tranindigo.github.io/posts/lambda-aws-alb/</link>

      <description>You can use a Lambda function to process requests from an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Since Lambda is a short running piece of code, it executes quickly in milliseconds and dies out. As such, each Lambda function must do only a single task and nothing more.&#xA;The support of ALBs for Lambda (and serverless, in general) is to enable your lambda function to be available as a web service. Lambda functions, by default, can&amp;rsquo;t be invoked through the internet.</description>
