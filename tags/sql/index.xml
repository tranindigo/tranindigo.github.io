      <description>When a table is created and does not have an index, this is called a heap. When new values are added to this table, values are added in no particular order. Using this structure, if we were to search for a particular value, we&amp;rsquo;ll have to search through every single row in the table not only because there is no order to the data, but even if we found a match, we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know if there were no more searches later on.</description>
