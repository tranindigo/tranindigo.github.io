      <description>AWS CloudWatch is a fully-managed service for monitoring AWS services and workloads. For websites, apps, and microservices that are entirely hosted on AWS, this is a great cloud logging solution.
As a fully-managed service, it is very easy to manage log retention periods, which can be configured on a per-group basis. By default, CloudWatch stores the log data indefinitely. Another advantage of CloudWatch is that it allows you to easily monitor host performance of AWS services.</description>
