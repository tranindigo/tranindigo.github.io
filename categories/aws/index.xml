      <title>How to serve Lambda through an AWS Load Balancer</title>

      <description>You can use a Lambda function to process requests from an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Since Lambda is a short running piece of code, it executes quickly in milliseconds and dies out. As such, each Lambda function must do only a single task and nothing more.
The support of ALBs for Lambda (and serverless, in general) is to enable your lambda function to be available as a web service. Lambda functions, by default, can&amp;rsquo;t be invoked through the internet.</description>

      <title>AWS CloudWatch: Monitoring &amp; Alarms</title>

      <description>AWS CloudWatch is a fully-managed service for monitoring AWS services and workloads. For websites, apps, and microservices that are entirely hosted on AWS, this is a great cloud logging solution.
As a fully-managed service, it is very easy to manage log retention periods, which can be configured on a per-group basis. By default, CloudWatch stores the log data indefinitely. Another advantage of CloudWatch is that it allows you to easily monitor host performance of AWS services.</description>

      <description>AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is a fully-managed service allows you to create and manage cryptographic keys and control their use across a wide range of AWS services. This is useful because it allows you to centrally manage the encryption keys that control access to your data.
Features KMS is durable to make sure that your keys are never lost. KMS stores multiple copies of encrypted versions of your keys in systems that are designed for 99.</description>

      <title>AWS Elasticache Caching Strategies</title>

      <description>Caching strategies dictate how you can populate and access data in the cache. There are two main strategies that AWS Elasticache uses: lazy loading and write-through.
Lazy Loading Lazy loading, also known as cache-aside caching, is a popular caching strategy. It works like the following:
 When your application needs to read data from a database, it checks the cache first to determine whether the data is available. If the data is available (a cache hit), the cached data is returned.</description>

      <title>Basics of Amazon VPC and Subnets</title>

      <description>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a private data center within the AWS infrastructure. You are able to decide the range of network IPv4 address range when you create the VPC. There is no way to change your VPC&amp;rsquo;s network block after it has been created.
A VPC consists of many components. A few that will be highlighted in this article are: subnets, Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, Route Table, and Network Access List.</description>
