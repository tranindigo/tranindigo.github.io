      <description>When a table is created and does not have an index, this is called a heap. When new values are added to this table, values are added in no particular order. Using this structure, if we were to search for a particular value, we&amp;rsquo;ll have to search through every single row in the table not only because there is no order to the data, but even if we found a match, we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know if there were no more searches later on.</description>

      <description>A stored procedure is a SQL script that can be stored on the database server and called many times. Stored procedures have been falling out of favor for many years, in favor of Object-Relational-Mappers (ORM) like Hibernate, Entity Framework, and ActiveRecord. However, there are times when it makes sense to use them as part of your development process, such as working with legacy systems or with multiple systems that rely on the same database.</description>
