      <title>How to create multi-stage Docker builds</title>

      <description>Multi-stage builds are a feature in Docker that allows you to build Docker images in multiple stages, each with its own base image and set of instructions. This can help you create smaller, more efficient Docker images by separating the build-time dependencies from the runtime dependencies.&#xA;How Multi-Stage Builds Work In a multi-stage Docker build, you specify multiple FROM instructions in your Dockerfile. Each FROM instruction can use a different base image and starts a new stage of the build.</description>

      <title>How to serve Lambda through an AWS Load Balancer</title>

      <description>You can use a Lambda function to process requests from an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Since Lambda is a short running piece of code, it executes quickly in milliseconds and dies out. As such, each Lambda function must do only a single task and nothing more.&#xA;The support of ALBs for Lambda (and serverless, in general) is to enable your lambda function to be available as a web service. Lambda functions, by default, can&amp;rsquo;t be invoked through the internet.</description>

      <title>How to modularize Terraform code</title>

      <description>Terraform modules allow us to group resources together, define input variables to allow different configurations, and define export variables to define how other resources or modules can use. You can think of modules as self-contained packages which can be used in different places. Modules can even be shared across teams in an organization or as open-source exports!&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have the following Datadog resource that is not modularized:&#xA;main.tf</description>
